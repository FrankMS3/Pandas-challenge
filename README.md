# Pandas-challenge
Creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.
Run the PyCitySchools_starter.ipnyb script located within the PyCitySchools folder, to print DataFrames analysing the two .csv files within the Resources folder.

# Conclusions:
1. Students attending independent schools appear to, on average, achieve better marks and pass rates than those attending government schools.
2. School size was negatively correlated with marks and pass rates (i.e. Smaller schools performed better than larger schools).
